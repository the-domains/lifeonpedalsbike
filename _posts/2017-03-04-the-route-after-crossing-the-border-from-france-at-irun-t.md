**The Route.** After crossing the border from France, at Irún, the coastal plain is followed, usually as far as Galicia before turning inland towards Santiago. The main towns on the route are San Sebastián/Donastia, Bilbao, Castro Urdiales, Santander, Ribadesella, Gijón, Avilés, Luarca, Ribadeo, Mondoñedo, and Sobrado dos Monxes, joining the _Camino francés_ at Arzua. Total distance from Irún to Santiago de Compostela 825 km (depending on route chosen).

Some pilgrims leave the coastal route at Villaviciosa to visit the largest Asturian monastery, and church of San Salvador (El Conventín), at Valdediós. They then continue to Oviedo where they join the _[Camino primitivo][0]_ to Lugo.

So we have decided, that we will take overnight train from Paris to Baynone. The train allows cycles. It have sleeping births and they provide blanket. The train starts from the Gare Austriz at 21:50 and arrive 08:30 to Baynone. So we can bike all day.
