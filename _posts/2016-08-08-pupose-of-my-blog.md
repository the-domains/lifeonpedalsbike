# Pupose of my BLOG

The purpose of my blog, that I want to inspire people to experience the beauty that we experience on our bikes and on our rides. It's a wonderful thing. My biggest goal is to inspire people to go out there and realize, "I can do this. It's safe. It's fun."

Ultimately, we shouldn't divide the bicycle world into racers and non-racers and this and that. In the end, we all share the joy of cycling. It can come in so many different guises. If I see someone who's riding their bike with a smile, I don't care whether they're on a WalMart cruiser or carbon racing bike or 650B randonneur bike. I want to inspire people and not tell them what to do or not to do.
