  Almost every Indian has a village they can be traced back to. This is true
  whether they were born in the countryside or in the chaos of a Bombay traffic
  jam. Huge chunks of the population still live in rural farming towns, hamlets
  with a few dusty lanes, some ambling livestock, and the promise of
  back-wrenching work at sunup. But all across India, the traditional farming
  village is disappearing. They are emptying –– becoming like the shells of
  forgotten towns one sees dotted around France and across the European
  countryside. Places where the elderly peer from the stoops of their worn-out
  porches, and crumbling, one-room schoolhouses serve as ghostly reminders of a
  time before kids moved away for boarding schools. What took Europe a hundred
  years, and America fifty, is happening to India within the span of a single
  generation. In India, you can literally watch globalization. The young are
  migrating en masse from the farming communities to the cities, looking for
  work, for opportunity, simply to move up. This is happening with special haste
  in Andhra Pradesh, the heartland of India’s cotton industry. Here, a
  dependence on cotton has forced many farmers to acknowledge that their staple
  crop can no longer support their families, their lifestyles, or their
  ambitions to join India’s rising middle class.
