            <title><![CDATA[My bike trips homepage]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>My bike trips homepage</h1><p>Almost every Indian has a village they can be traced back to. This is true whether they were born in the countryside or in the chaos of a Bombay traffic jam. Huge chunks of the population still live in rural farming towns, hamlets with a few dusty lanes, some ambling livestock, and the promise of back-wrenching work at sunup. But all across India, the traditional farming village is disappearing. They are emptying –– becoming like the shells of forgotten towns one sees dotted around France and across the European countryside. Places where the elderly peer from the stoops of their worn-out porches, and crumbling, one-room schoolhouses serve as ghostly reminders of a time before kids moved away for boarding schools. What took Europe a hundred years, and America fifty, is happening to India within the span of a single generation. In India, you can literally watch globalization. The young are migrating en masse from the farming communities to the cities, looking for work, for opportunity, simply to move up. This is happening with special haste in Andhra Pradesh, the heartland of India’s cotton industry. Here, a dependence on cotton has forced many farmers to acknowledge that their staple crop can no longer support their families, their lifestyles, or their ambitions to join India’s rising middle class.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/c3f8789e-ddaf-4fc8-b11d-a5ae9abb999f.jpg"></article>]]></description>
